      // Now, let's write our first code block of React. We're going to use ES6 classes to create a React component called App.
      class App extends React.Component {
        // the render() method, the only required method in a class component, which is used to render DOM nodes.
        render() {
            return (
                // Inside the return, we're going to put what looks like a simple HTML element. Note that we're not returning a string here, so don't use quotes around the element. This is called JSX, and we'll learn more about it soon.

      // JSX: JavaScript + XML
      // As you've seen, we've been using what looks like HTML in our React code, but it's not quite HTML. This is JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML.
      // With JSX, we can write what looks like HTML, and also we can create and use our own XML-like tags. Here's what JSX looks like assigned to a variable.
      const element1 = <h1 className="site-heading">Hello, React</h1>
      
      // Using JSX is not mandatory for writing React. Under the hood, it's running createElement, which takes the tag, object containing the properties, and children of the component and renders the same information. The below code will have the same output as the JSX above.
      // JSX is actually closer to JavaScript, not HTML, so there are a few key differences to note when writing it.
      /* 
        - className is used instead of class for adding CSS classes, as class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
        - Properties and methods in JSX are camelCase - onclick will become onClick.
        - Self-closing tags must end in a slash - e.g. <img />
      */
